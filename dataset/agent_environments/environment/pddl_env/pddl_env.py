    The robot has four actions: pickup, putdown, stack, and unstack. The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.
    The actions defined in this domain include:
    pickup <block>: allows the arm to pick up a block from the table if it is clear and the arm is empty. After the pickup action, the arm will be holding the block, and the block will no longer be on the table or clear.
    putdown <block>: allows the arm to put down a block on the table if it is holding a block. After the putdown action, the arm will be empty, and the block will be on the table and clear.
    stack <block> <block>: allows the arm to stack a block on top of another block if the arm is holding the top block and the bottom block is clear. After the stack action, the arm will be empty, the top block will be on top of the bottom block, and the bottom block will no longer be clear.
    unstack <block> <block>: allows the arm to unstack a block from on top of another block if the arm is empty and the top block is clear. After the unstack action, the arm will be holding the top block, the top block will no longer be on top of the bottom block, and the bottom block will be clear.

    You are a robot barman that manipulates drink dispensers, shot glasses and a shaker. You have two hands. The goal is to find a plan that serves a desired set of drinks. Here are the actions you can do

    <hand> grasp <container>: Grasp a container
    <hand> leave <container>: Leave a container on the table
    fill-shot <shot> <ingredient> <hand1> <hand2> <dispenser>: Fill a shot glass with an ingredient from dispenser
    refill-shot <shot> <ingredient> <hand1> <hand2> <dispenser>: Refill a shot glass with an ingredient from dispenser
    empty-shot <hand> <shot> <beverage>: Empty a shot glass
    clean-shot <shot> <beverage> <hand1> <hand2>: Clean a shot glass
    pour-shot-to-clean-shaker <shot> <ingredient> <shaker> <hand1> <level1> <level2>: Pour an ingredient from a shot glass to a clean shaker from level1 to level2
    pour-shot-to-used-shaker <shot> <ingredient> <shaker> <hand1> <level1> <level2>: Pour an ingredient from a shot glass to a used shaker from level1 to level2
    empty-shaker <hand> <shaker> <cocktail> <level1> <level2>: Empty a shaker containing cocktail from level1 to level2

    pour-shaker-to-shot <beverage> <shot> <hand> <shaker> <level1> <level2>: Pour a beverage from a shaker to a shot glass from level1 to level2

    You have the following restrictions on your actions:
    You can only grasp a container if your hand is empty and it is on the table.
    You can only leave a container if you are holding it.
    You can only fill a shot glass if you are holding the shot glass, your other hand is empty, the shot glass is empty and clean.
    You can only refill a shot glass if you are holding the shot glass, your other hand is empty, the shot glass is empty and has contained the saree ingredient before.
    You can only empty a shot glass if you are holding the shot glass and it contains a beverage.
    You can only pour from a shot glass to a clean shaker if you are holding the shot glass, the shot glass contains an ingredient, and the shaker is empty and clean.
    You can only pour from a shot glass to a used shaker if you are holding the shot glass, the shot glass contains an ingredient, the shaker is unshaked and at a level not full.
    You can only empty a shaker if you are holding the shaker and the shaker contains a shaked beverage.
    You can only clean a shaker if you are holding the shaker, your other hand is empty, and the shaker is empty.
    You can only shake a cocktail if you are holding the shaker, your other hand is empty, the shaker is unshaked, and the shaker contains two ingredients, and both ingredients are parts of a cocktail.
    You can only pour from a shaker to a shot glass if you are holding the shaker, the shaker contains the cocktail, the shaker is shaked, and the shot glass is empty and clean.

    Once you grasp a container, you are holding the container and the container is not on the table.
    Once you leave a container on the table, your hand become empty.
    Once you pour an ingredient from a shot glass to a shaker, the shaker contains the ingredient and is at one level above the previous level, and the shot glass becomes empty.
    Once you empty a shaker, the shaker is at the empty level.
    Once you shake, the two ingredients in the shaker become a cocktail.
    Once you pour from a shaker to a shot glass, the shot glass contains the beverage in the shaker, the shot glass is no longer clean and empty, and the shaker is at one level below the previous level.
