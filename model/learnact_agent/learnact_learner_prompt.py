Failed reason: According to the definition of build_block_pillar and the execution process, when executing build_block_pillar, Pickup is executed first, followed by the iterative execution of Stack for the blocks. However, this sequence is invalid because before running Stack(block_list[i - 1], block_list[i]), it is necessary to execute Pickup(block_list[i-1]). Additionally, the order of the Stack operation is incorrect. Executing Stack(block_list[i - 1], block_list[i]) before Stack(block_list[i], block_list[i+1]) is not valid because block_list[i] is located beneath block_list[i - 1], making it impossible to Pickup. To rectify this, the iteration should be performed in reverse order.

But error is observed (The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect):
Action: left grasp shot1
Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please remember to satisfy the restriction of actions. You can also check valid actions.

Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please check valid actions.
Action: clean-shot glass shot1 with ingredient1 with hand left holding shot glass and right
Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please check valid actions.
Action: left leave shot1
Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please remember to satisfy the restriction of actions. You can also check valid actions.

Failed reason: According to the definition of "prepare_cocktail" and the execution process, the initial step in executing "prepare_cocktail" is to first grasp shot1 with the left hand, which is not valid. This is because the grasp shot action requires that the shot be on the table, which is not the case in this scenario (the shot is held in the right hand). The agent should enhance its plan and release the shot from the right hand if necessary.
Improve: Plan ['prepare_cocktail']
Content: Before calling prepare_cocktail, I should ensure that the target shot is on the table. To address this, I should execute a leave action before prepare_cocktail, ensuring that the shot is appropriately placed on the table for the subsequent steps.

Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 3, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.
Action: goto_and_retrieve("plate", "cabinet 1")
Observation: On the cabinet 1, you see a bowl 1.
Action: examine("cabinet 1")
Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please remember to satisfy the restriction of actions. You can also check valid actions.
Action: goto_and_retrieve("plate", "cabinet 2")
Observation: You open the cabinet 2. The cabinet 2 is open. In it, you see a mug 1, and a soapbottle 1.
Action: goto_and_retrieve("plate", "cabinet 3")
Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please remember to satisfy the restriction of actions. On the cabinet 3, you see a plate 1, and a vase 2.

But an error is observed in the last call (The action is not valid and, therefore, takes no effect). The detailed subprocess of this step is:
Action: go to cabinet 3
Observation: On the cabinet 3, you see a plate 1, and a vase 2.
Action: take plate from cabinet 3
Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please remember to satisfy the restriction of actions.

Failed reason: According to the definition of "goto_and_retrieve" and the execution process, the step "take" is invalid when executing "goto_and_retrieve." The error is caused by the input argument "plate" being invalid. The input for "take" should be "plate 1" in the observation. However, since we don't know the ID of the object before calling "goto_and_retrieve," the input for "goto_and_retrieve" can only be ("plate", "cabinet 3"). Therefore, we should parse the object name "plate 1" from the observation.

Failed reason: According to the definitions of "goto_and_put" and the execution process, the steps "goto" and "put" are invalid when executing "goto_and_clean." The error arises because I am already at "countertop 1," making it unnecessary to go there again. To avoid this error, I should call "goto_and_put" directly after finding and taking the target object, instead of calling "goto" prior to "goto_and_put." Additionally, the "put" step is invalid because the input argument "plate" is incorrect. It should be "plate 1," which I had previously found and taken.
Improve: Plan ['goto_and_put']
Content: The "goto_and_put" function should be called directly after finding and taking the target object, instead of calling "goto" before "goto_and_put". Moreover, the "obj" argument should be the specific object that was previously found and taken.

Observation: On the cabinet 1, you see a bowl 1.
Action: examine("cabinet 1")
Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please remember to satisfy the restriction of actions. You can also check valid actions.

Observation: You pick up the plate 1 from the cabinet 3.
Action: goto("microwave 1")
Observation: On microwave 1, you see nothing.
Action: goto_and_heat("plate", "microwave 1")
Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please remember to satisfy the restriction of actions.

But an error is observed in the last call (The action is not valid and, therefore, takes no effect). The detailed subprocess of this step is:
Action: go to microwave 1
Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please remember to satisfy the restriction of actions.
Action: heat plate in/on microwave 1
Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please remember to satisfy the restriction of actions.

Failed reason: According to the definitions of "goto_and_heat" and the execution process, the steps "goto" and "heat" are invalid when executing "goto_and_heat." The error arises because I am already at "microwave 1," making it unnecessary to go there again. To avoid this error, I should call "goto_and_heat" directly after finding and taking the target object, instead of calling "goto" prior to "goto_and_heat." Additionally, the "heat" step is invalid because the input argument "plate" is incorrect. It should be "plate 1," which I had previously found and taken.
Improve: Plan ['goto_and_heat']
Content: The "goto_and_heat" function should be called directly after finding and taking the target object, instead of calling "goto" before "goto_and_heat". Moreover, the "obj" argument should be the specific object that was previously found and taken.

Goal: Your task is to: examine the mug with the desklamp.
Observation: You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 2, a desk 1, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a laundryhamper 1, a safe 1, a shelf 6, a shelf 5, a shelf 4, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, and a shelf 1.

Observation: You put the mug 3 in/on the desk 1.
Action: toggle_and_examine("desklamp 1", "desk 1")
Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please remember to satisfy the restriction of actions.

But an error is observed in the last call (The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect). The detailed subprocess of this step is:
Action: go to desk 1
Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please remember to satisfy the restriction of actions.

Failed reason: According to the definition of "toggle_and_examine" and the execution process, the step "goto" is invalid when executing "toggle_and_examine." The error is caused by the fact that I am already at the "desk 1", so I do not need to go to "desk 1" again. I should avoid such an error by directly calling toggle_and_examine after finding and taking the target object, rather than calling goto before toggle_and_examine.
Improvement: Plan ['goto_and_retrieve']
Content: After finding and taking the target object, I should call toggle_and_examine on the target receptacles directly instead of calling goto to the target receptacles.

Observation: The action is not valid and therefore takes no effect. Please remember to satisfy the restriction of actions.

Failed reason: According to the definition of "goto_and_retrieve" and the execution process, the step "take" is invalid when executing "goto_and_retrieve." The error is caused by the input argument "plate" being invalid. The input for "take" should be "plate 1" in the observation. However, since we don't know the ID of the object before calling "goto_and_retrieve," the input for "goto_and_retrieve" can only be ("plate", "cabinet 3"). Therefore, we should parse the object name "plate 1" from the observation.

Failed reason: According to the definitions of "goto_and_put" and the execution process, the steps "goto" and "put" are invalid when executing "goto_and_clean." The error arises because I am already at "countertop 1," making it unnecessary to go there again. To avoid this error, I should call "goto_and_put" directly after finding and taking the target object, instead of calling "goto" prior to "goto_and_put." Additionally, the "put" step is invalid because the input argument "plate" is incorrect. It should be "plate 1," which I had previously found and taken.
Improve: Plan ['goto_and_put']
Content: The "goto_and_put" function should be called directly after finding and taking the target object, instead of calling "goto" before "goto_and_put". Moreover, the "obj" argument should be the specific object that was previously found and taken.
